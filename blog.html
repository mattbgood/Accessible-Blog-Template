Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the
blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful
Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small
line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.
The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question
Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her
initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic
Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of
Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her
cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.
The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand
times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text
should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her
and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe
and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again.
And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.
